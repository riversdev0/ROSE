# ROSE
Calendar Management Utility

ROSE is a calendar management utility aimed at helping churches organize voluteers. ROSE provides one central location for viewing schedules, modifying assignments, trading assignments, and managing reminders. ROSE is designed to relieve administrative duty from your office staff by facilitating trades and reminders.

Features:
 - Live information - information stays up to date, unlike paper schedules
 - Customizable reminders - email reminders exactly the way you want them
 - Self registration - allows new church members to register for an account
 - Trade management - makes trading assignments easy
 - Printer friendly - for those who are still in the previous decade

Limitations:
 - Assignments in ROSE do not include times, just dates.
 - Trades can not occur between different roles. For example, a worker in "9 am Nursery" is not able to trade with someone in "10:30 am Nursery". (This would make a great feature enhancement.)

Requirements:
 - ROSE is written in PHP, so your webserver requires a PHP interpreter.
 - ROSE uses MySQL to store its information, so it requires one MySQL database.
